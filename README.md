# nowplaying-arduino
A sketch for arduino that receives text from an OSX client and displays it on an LCD.

What is it?

If you install this sketch using the Arduino IDE, your arduino can wait for ASCII characters to be written
to its digital input port, and then display that on a SparkFun LCD (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/709)

This code is very loosely based on the example code provided by Sparkfun (https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/246)
